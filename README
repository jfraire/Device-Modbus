Device-Modbus version 0.01
==========================

This distribution aims towards implementing Modbus communications in Perl. It should be possible to use it to write Modbus TCP and RTU clients and servers.

In particular, servers should be able to execute arbitrary code to process requests. This will allow for applications such as Modbus gateways, RTU packet spies, or database front-end applications that communicates directly with external devices. 

CURRENT STATUS

Currently, only blocking Modbus TCP clients are functional.

MILESTONES

- Non-blocking Modbus TCP clients
