Device-Modbus version 0.01
==========================

This distribution aims towards implementing Modbus communications in Perl. It should be possible to write Modbus TCP and RTU clients and servers.

In particular, servers should be able to execute arbitrary code to process requests. This will allow for applications such as Modbus gateways, RTU packet spies, or database front-end applications that communicate directly with external devices. 

CURRENT STATUS

Currently, the distribution is under development. It has been successfully tested as TCP and RTU client, as TCP server, and as RTU spy.

MILESTONES

- Modbus TCP server module to be used along with Net::Daemon
- Non-blocking Modbus TCP clients
- Modbus RTU client
- Modbus RTU server
- Modbus RTU spy

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other non-standard modules and libraries:

  * Moo

SEE ALSO

In Perl, you can find other Modbus related distributions. I think the
leading one would be Protocol::Modbus, by Cossimo, which implements
Modbus TCP clients. While there is code for RTU clients, it is not as
mature.

There are also some scripts that implement both servers and clients.
A couple worth looking at is formed by MBclient and mbserved. The
later is available in GitHub and they were both written by the same
author.
